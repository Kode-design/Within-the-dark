Within The Dark: Project Overview
1. Core Concept
* Title: Within The Dark
* Genre: Horror • Fighting • Drama
* Style: 2D Pixelated Side-Scroller
* Logline: 10,000 years after monsters lost a brutal war against humanity, a powerful undead warrior is reawakened. As a member of a radical monster faction, he must battle through a world of uneasy peace to uncover forgotten truths and decide whether to reignite a war that could doom everyone.
2. Current Status: A Feature-Complete Prototype
We have successfully built a robust prototype from scratch using Python and Pygame. The core architecture is in place, and all major gameplay systems designed for the prologue are functional.
Implemented Engine & Core Systems:
* Game Loop & State Machine: The game correctly manages separate states for the Main Menu, active Gameplay, Paused screen, and Game Over screen.
* Tile-Based World: The game generates levels from a simple string-based level_map, creating a world with solid platforms, walls, and verticality.
* Side-Scrolling Camera: A smooth camera follows the player, allowing for levels larger than a single screen.
* Physics Engine: A custom physics system handles gravity, movement, and tile-based collision for both the player and ground-based enemies.
* Sound & Animation Placeholders: The underlying systems to play sounds and cycle through animation frames are built and working.
Implemented Player & Dread Mechanics:
* Full Player Moveset: Khristopher can walk, run, jump, dash, and block.
* Aiming & Combat: The player has a mouse-controlled crosshair for aiming, a standard light attack, and a risk/reward charged heavy attack.
* Complete Ability System: Dread's entire new cooldown-based moveset is implemented:
   * Passive: Automatically floats and fires orbs at nearby enemies.
   * Ability 1 (Spectral Hand): A targeted, 3-hit area-of-effect slam.
   * Ability 2 (Screech): An area-of-effect stun and knockback.
   * Ability 3 (Devour): A single-target execute or high-damage attack.
   * Ability 4 (Aspect Of Dread): An ultimate "super" mode with enhanced AI and attacks.
* Interaction: The player can approach and interact (E key) with lore objects in the world to display text.
Implemented Content:
* Enemy Roster: All three prologue enemies are in the game: the ground-based Shambling Undead, the floating Tormented Spirit, and the tough Crypt Guardian mini-boss.
* Boss Fight Mechanic: The Crypt Guardian acts as a gatekeeper, and defeating it correctly removes a physical barrier (G tiles) from the level, allowing the player to proceed.
* Functional UI: The game displays the player's health, all ability cooldowns, the crosshair, and lore text boxes.

3. Future Improvements and Roadmap
The separate file `Proposed_Improvements.txt` contains over 1000 ideas for expanding "Within The Dark" beyond the prologue. These range from new abilities and enemies to quality-of-life features. The team can consult this list when planning updates and additional episodes.
